# Map Project
## About the Project

This project aims to use some features of react native. First, a map was generated with google API to identify the user's location and to check the UEA-EST location as a MARK on the map.
The second feature was to create a QRCode and BarCode reader and all the reading was stored in phone memory using @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

- Map
